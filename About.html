<p>I am from Sparta, New Jersey and am a Kean University senior majoring 
    in Information Technology focusing on the cybersecurity option. 
    I am to graduate in the Spring of 2023 with a Bachelors in the above 
    major. I am in a relationship which I've now been in for over a year.
    My partner is also at college at Montclair State University,
    studying Early Childhood Development focusing on the Childhood
    disabilities option. She is aiming to get her Masters in the 
    previously mentioned degree. In my free time, I enjoy reading science
     fiction, primarily from the late Michael Crichton; writing science 
     fiction; and watching tokusatsu, a Japanese television genre focusing 
    on suited actors fighting an evil they are somehow related to.</p>

    <p>I enjoy reading science fiction, primarily from the late Michael 
    Crichton. I have currently finished reading Jurassic Park and The Lost 
    World: Jurassic Park. I am in the process of reading Prey, a book
    focusing on nanotechnology.</p>
    <break>
    <p>As previously stated, I enjoy writing science fiction in my
    freetime. My writing involves the multiverse and its unlimited 
    possibilities. My writing has stories involving cyborgs to 
    almost mythical beings born of the cosmos. Some stories involve
    the creation of monsters such as the Terrors or the Inhumanoids.
    All of the stories intertwine though resulting in characters 
    getting to know their counterparts. The big bad of the first few
    phases is an elder god of the multiverse born at its creation, 
    whom became fed up with his brothers and sisters, and destroyed
    them all. 
    </p>
    <break>
    <p>As mentioned above, I enjoy watching tokusatsu, a Japanese 
    television genre. The tokusatsu genre is a mix of drama, science
    fiction, and superhero. Tokusatsu translates to "specail filmmaking"
    as the suit acting is where the specail filming comes from. I got 
    into the genre back in 2017 during my first year of community college
    due to what the next season of Power Rangers was to be based on which
    was Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters, which celebrated the American adaption
    of the Japanese genre. From there, I went on to watch several movies 
    and television shows of the genre with my favorite primary Kamen Riders
    being: Zero-One, Zi-O, Build, Gaim, OOO, Den-O, and Kuuga. My favorite secondary
    Kamen Riders are: Geiz, Cross-Z, Baron, and Zeronos. My favorite tertiary 
    Kamen Riders are: Woz, Grease, Chaser, and Ryugen. My favorite 
    quaternary Kamen Riders are: Demons, Rogue, Snipe, and Zangestsu (Shin). 
    My favorite Dark Kamen Riders are: Ark-Zero, Blood, Evolt, and Poseidon.</p>
